Very often, when I'm researching the Franklin Expedition (as you do), I'm dissapointed in the lack of collective information that there is out there. Most people's passion projects on this expedition focus on one particular lens, whether that be through a person, a specific object, or a specific part of the expedition. I am so abnormal about this expedition that I cannot even choose my favourite part of it, let alone my favourite member of the expedition. My goal is to have as much information about this expedition as I can, and I love sharing what I learn with people.

I hope that with this website, I can share more information about the ships, the crew, the artefacts, the Inuit testimonies that helped us figure out the story, and the build-up and wind-down of the Franklin Expedition and the desire for the Northwest Passage. It makes me very upset that these men have not been remembered for more than their names, and a majority of them aren't even known for their names. I go to a really nerdy college, and I have had to tell people what the Franklin Expedition was many times. It was such an interesting piece of history that is so often overlooked, and when it is looked into, much of the context is removed.

One of my favourite things to do is to contextualize artefacts. I wanted to be an archeologist for a long time, but due to my disabilities, it's entirely out of the picture. This is what I do instead -- I turn into Victor Frankenstein and lock myself in my room and just research and write about artefacts until I have a thought that is important to me. A few weeks ago (as of October 2nd, 2025), I did just this for the Peglar Papers, and became obsessed with the idea of doing this for the artefacts that we have from the Franklin Expedition. While I am aware that what I did for the Peglar Papers (researching the individual (Peglar in this case), cross-referencing information, and analyzing the language) will not apply to a lot of the artefacts (such as the furniture leg, bell, cannon, etc), I know that I will still find immense joy in understanding the backgrounds of these objects more.
